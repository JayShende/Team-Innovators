## Problem Statement :
Recycling facilities often have a large volume of waste to sort through, and manually sorting
through this waste can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The problem is to develop a
machine learning model that can accurately detect and classify different types of waste in
images, such as plastic, paper, metal, etc. The goal is to create a model that can improve
sorting efficiency and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.

## Solutions :
- An AI powered smart trashcan / Robot / Machine that segregates trash without human intervention & improves waste management operations

## About :
GOSS is a Machine learning model that can accurately detect
and classify different types of waste in images, such as plastic, paper, metal, etc.
