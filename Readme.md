## Problem Statement :
Recycling facilities often have a large volume of waste to sort through, and manually sorting
through this waste can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The problem is to develop a
machine learning model that can accurately detect and classify different types of waste in
images, such as plastic, paper, metal, etc. The goal is to create a model that can improve
sorting efficiency and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.

## Survey & Research :
Recycling contamination occurs when waste is incorrectly disposed of — like recycling a pizza box with oil on it (compost). Or when waste is correctly disposed of but incorrectly prepared — like recycling unrinsed jam jars.
Contamination is a huge problem in the recycling industry that can be mitigated with automated waste sorting. This is an application **optical sorting system**.

**Official numbers** say that we generate more than **62 million tonnes** of municipal solid waste but only **43 million tonnes** is collected. Of the 43 million tonnes collected, municipalities are forced to dump more than **31 million** in landfills due to its mixed nature.


## Solutions :
- An AI powered smart trashcan / Robot / Machine that segregates trash without human intervention & improves waste management operations

## About :
GOSS is a Machine learning model that can accurately detect
and classify different types of waste in images, such as plastic, paper, metal, etc.
